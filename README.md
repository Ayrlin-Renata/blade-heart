# BLADE HEART

A fan-project to make a better Honkai Impact 3rd supporting content consumption experience.

**Primarily featuring: **
BLADE HEART: a comics/manga reader of the same name by me, Ayrlin

## so-called "features"
1. comments ripped straight out of microsoft word (this is a joke, i wrote it all myself)
2. whacking readers over the head with wikipedia and the dictionary

## future disappointments:
2.5 (too lazy to change numbers): easy language source switch
3. automatic bgm sync 
4. sfx triggers  
5. custom account-based note saving and submission?
6. Voiceover submission ???
7. ???

i like this game a normal amount
new players should have an easier time reading the based lore
